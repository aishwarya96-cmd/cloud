- ***Lambda is a serverless computing platform provided by aws.***
- ***Lambda function can store multiple codes without any costing.***
- ***It will charge you only at the time of execution of code.***
- ***Whenever you run your code it will automatically calculaute CPU,RAM and multiply the amount of time for which the code is run and charge CPU,RAM only for that time period.***
- ***It provides scalibilty i.e automaticallly calculates the cost required in case you update your code by increasing or decreasing cpu,ram or time.***
- ***It provides parallelization i.e at each execution time if their are multiple requests coming to lambda it automatically manages each request.***
